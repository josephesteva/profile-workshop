				<p>Skiing is an awesome sport that is tons of fun! North America has some
					great mountains for skiing. It is worth it to travel out West, where the
					skiing is significantly better than on the East Coast! The views are 
					absolutely beautiful and the terrain is tons of fun! 
				</p>
				<p>As a new skier, it is best to stick to green routes and stay on groomed 
					trails. Intermediate skiers can comfortably ski on more varied terrain and
					begin to take advantage of the really fun stuff. Skiing through tree runs
					and moguls is incredibly fun and rewarding for skiers who are up to the
					challenge!
				</p>
				<p>Snowboarding is also fun but skiing is better!</p>
